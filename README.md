# Nature-s-Binary-Ladder
The paper proposes **Nature’s Binary Ladder**, a universal hierarchy where major scales recur every (2^{16}) in size, with connector scales one byte ((2^{8})) above each. Anchored at the Planck length, this dyadic framework unifies emergence across physics, biology, and cosmology, linking information, entropy, and complexity.
